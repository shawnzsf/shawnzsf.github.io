<h1 id="1-1">1.1</h1>
<h2 id="environmental-history">Environmental History</h2>
<ol>
<li>Significant historical influences on the development of the environmental movement have come from literature, the media, major environmental disasters, international agreements and technological developments. (a minimum of 3 in-depth examples).</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Montreal Protocol: The Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer is the landmark multilateral environmental agreement that regulates the production and consumption of nearly 100 man-made chemicals referred to as ozone depleting substances (ODS).</li>
<li>Deadly Smog-London: The Great Smog of London, or Great Smog of 1952, was a severe air pollution event that affected London, England, in December 1952. Perhaps 12,000 people die.</li>
<li>Publication of Silent Spring by Rachel Carson: Highlighting problems of DDT on ecosystems - led to a general raising of awareness of environmental issues by the public</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="environmental-value-system">Environmental Value System</h2>
<ol>
<li>Define an Environmental Value System and describe the differences between the Ecocentric, Technocentric and Anthropocentric EVSs.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Definition: A worldview or paradigmthat shapes the way an individual, or group of people, perceives and evaluates environmental issues, influenced by cultural, religious, economic and socio-political contexts.</li>
<li>Ecocentric:
<ul>
<li>Integrates social, spiritual and environmental dimensions into an holistic ideal.</li>
<li>Ecology and nature are central to humanity</li>
<li>Emphasises a less materialistic approach to life with greater self-sufficiency of societies.</li>
<li>Prioritises biorights (a matter of morals)</li>
<li>Emphasises importance of education is key</li>
<li>Encourages self-restraint</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Anthropocentric:
<ul>
<li>Humans must sustainably manage the global system.</li>
<li>Might use taxes, environmental regulation and legislation</li>
<li>Debate encouraged to reach a consensus</li>
<li>Pragmatic approach to solving environmental problems</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Technocentric:
<ul>
<li>Technology developments can provide solutions to environmental problems.</li>
<li>Largely optimistic view of the role humans can play in improving the lot of humanity</li>
<li>Scientific research is encouraged in order to form policies and to understand how systems can be controlled, manipulated or changed to solve resource depletion</li>
<li>A pro-growth agenda is deemed necessary for society’s improvement</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2">
<li>Explain how a particular EVS might approach an environmental issue<br>
书里没写，但根据上面的应该也可以自己写了。<br>
这里补充一下：
<ul>
<li>Ecocentric: Deep Ecologist</li>
<li>Technocentric: Cornucopian</li>
<li>Anthropocentric: Environmental Manager</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Discuss the intrinsic value of the environment and how different EVSs feel about this<br>
Intrinsic value is the value of the nature itself, despite the commercial or social value.</li>
<li>Be able to evaluate how an environmental issue may be approached by a combination of many different EVSs<br>
同样可以用上面那一长串的定义回答。</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="1-2">1.2</h1>
<h2 id="systems-and-models">Systems and Models</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Describe a system with its flows, stores, transfers and transformations of energy and matter.</p>
<ul>
<li>A system is any collection of components that work together to perform a function.</li>
<li>the system if made up of component parts</li>
<li>the parts work together</li>
<li>the whole thing serves some purpose</li>
<li>transfer do not change the form of energy, while transformation do.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Apply this to a variety of systems including unknown and novel systems to you including drawing a diagram to represent the system</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Understand the difference between open, closed and isolated systems and be able to identify a system as one of these.</p>
<ul>
<li>Isolated Systems:
<ul>
<li>no exchange of energy or material across the system boundaries</li>
<li>such systems don’t exist in the natural world</li>
<li>the entire cosmos could be considered to be an isolated system</li>
<li>Recently isolated caves have been discovered in which the source of energy is minerals in the rocks which are utilised by chemoautotrophs. Even these cannot be considered as isolated systems due to leakage of water, the occasional input of organisms or minerals from other systems.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Closed Systems:
<ul>
<li>exchange energy but not material across the system boundaries</li>
<li>the global water cycle is a closed system because there is a fixed amount of material (water) within the system and the circulation of water is maintained by energy from the sun which comes across the system boundary.</li>
<li>Other global cycles of minerals are also examples of closed systems.</li>
<li>an artificial example is Biosphere II which was created by scientists in the USA</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Open Systems:
<ul>
<li>exchange of energy and materials freely across the system boundary</li>
<li>most environmental systems, such as drainage basins, lakes and forests, are open</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Discuss why the global geochemical cycles approximate to closed systems<br>
There is a fixed amount of material within the system and the circulation of materials is maintained by energy from the sun which comes across the system boundary.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="structure-of-a-system">Structure of a System</h2>
<ol>
<li>A system is comprised of storages and flows.</li>
<li>The flows provide inputs and outputs of energy and matter.</li>
<li>The flows are processes that may be either transfers (a change in location) or transformations (a change in the chemical nature, a change in state or a change in<br>
energy).</li>
<li>In system diagrams, storages are usually represented as rectangular boxes and flows as arrows, with the direction of each arrow indicating the direction of each flow. The size of the boxes and the arrows may be representative of the size / magnitude of the storage or flow.</li>
<li>The first law of thermodynamics is the principle of conservation of energy, which states that energy in an isolated system can be transformed but cannot be created or destroyed.</li>
<li>The principle of conservation of energy can be modelled by the energy transformations along food chains and energy production systems.</li>
<li>The second law of thermodynamics states that the entropy of a system increases over time. Entropy is a measure of the amount of disorder in a system. An increase in entropy arising from energy transformations reduces the energy available to do work.</li>
<li>The second law of thermodynamics explains the inefficiency and decrease in available energy along a food chain and energy generation systems.</li>
